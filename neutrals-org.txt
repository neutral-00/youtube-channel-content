## Purpose of the organization
- create a system to nurture benevolent souls.

## What is my intention?
- create a virtual organization.
- provide a networking platform for benevolent souls.
- a platform to fecilitate Quality Services by the benevolent souls and for the benevolent souls.
- This is an organization only for benevolent souls.

## What you can do by joining this network?
- You can propose one selfless/casteless/community-less goal that you want to achieve during your life-time.
- And other souls whose goals also align with the proposed goal can join and form a team
- Then the teams works to achieve the goal.
- You may be on the giving end or receiving end of a service.
- If you are on the giving end, you will earn good karma points.

## Example of individual service - Giving cost-effective transport
- Suppose person X is travelling alone in his/her vehicle from point A to B.
- And X has the capacity to accomodate one passenger.
- X wants to help someone by giving him/her lift anywhere before/until point B at half the cost of public transport fare.
- What is the risk involve here?
	- Some people may consider X as a scammer/someone with malicious intent.
	- In another scenario, the person whom X is offering help may inturn try to harm/loot X.
	- One more scenario is if someone who earns his/her living by driving passenger vehicle may not like X's action/decision and try to harm X.
	- There is a friction to achieve this good karma. How do we make sure no one gets harm here?
	- Solution:
		- Identify the person offering help(X) is a benevolent soul.
		- Identify the person receiving help(Y) is also a benevolent soul.
		- Provide a platform where both parties know what they are offering and receiving.

## Why Benevolent souls only?
- Because it will greatly reduce risk and friction to accomplish a good karma.
- The good works that will be carried out by you/ your team may be seen as a threat to other parties whose interest conflicts with the outome of your work.
- It is natural that enemies will be formed.
- Enemies may try to harm you/the organization. 
- So it is extremely important to identify members joining the network are benevolent and communicate anomymously.
- It is extremly important to make sure the service is for and by benevolent souls only.

## How the system will work?
- So Neutrals organization provide a system where benevolent souls can identify each other and help each other anonymously.
- Each benevolent soul will be given a virtual id card, the owner can only see his or her details. 
- alphanumeric id
- The event should be recorded in the system by Y in the format.
	<person offering help>: anonymous id of X (to be scaned by Y
- Why should we record the event? Isn't there a risk of someone else misusing this information?
- Answer to the first question is
	- to reward the person offering help with a good karma point. So anyone doing good actions will get positive karma points.
	- and it will be tracked in the system to

### Organizational Hierarchy
- There should not be anyone from group acting as leader/boss nor there will be a group of people controlling all the decisions/actions.
- There will be only collective actions and decisions.
- In case of conflict voting will be considered as the final resolution. A tie in voting should be considered as a no go.
- There will only be two categories of beings in this group:
	- junior (will have a voting right of 1 point)
	- senior (will have a voting right of 2 points) and has access to meditation centers
- There should not be any other divison other than junior and senior.

## Guidelines
- Always prefer to collaborate in a team.
- The cost of the service one offers  
	- should be affordable and not expensive.
	- can be absolutely free once you gathered initial cost and some profit.
	- goal of your service should be affordability.
	- The work/service you/your team provide should ease the livelyhood of other benevolent souls.


## Why the service you/your team provides should not absolutely free?
	- if everything becomes free, a lot of us will become lazy and stop working.
	- we all work day and night directly or indirectly to earn money.
	- We all need money to get going in life, so money is important and never ignore it.
	- But we must earn it ethically. There is no room for unethical earnings.
